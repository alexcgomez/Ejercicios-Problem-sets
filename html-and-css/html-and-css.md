Mini-projects
-------------

1. Prepare your personal web page (if you don't have one already):

   * Write something minimal with information about what your job is and things you have done, a sort of informal resum√©. Link it to your social network profiles.

   * Use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host it. 
   
   * Buy a [cheap domain](https://namecheap.com/) for it if you can. (Check the documentation on how you can use your domain with Github Pages.)
